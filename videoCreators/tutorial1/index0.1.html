          &nbsp; &nbsp; VideoCrafter is a video creation toolbox consisting of:
            <ul>
                <li> A text-to-video (T2V) diffusion model : LVDM  
                <li> A finetuning mechanism to train the LVDM on specific datasets and reduce training parameters : VideoLoRA 
                <li> A conditional adapter based on T2I-adpater to increase the controls on video generation

        </h4>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a couple of ways you ccan lay around with VideoCrafter. You can run it locally, run a demo on HuggingFace or
          the Google Colabatory notebook.
          Here's a guide on how to get the results you want from VideoCrafter. 
    
          <ul>
              <li>
                Sampling steps : the number of sampling steps used adjusts how much the diffusion model denoises the data (which in a diffusion model is 100% random noise) per step. At every step the model is predicting what the image is supposed to look like. Adding more steps implies that execution will take longer but at every step the model is making a probabilistic assumption based on a less noisy image.
              </li>
            <!-- Mention in the paper where this comes up when you're talking about variance in the diffusion process -->
              <li> CFG scale : Stands for Coefficient of Fluctuation Growth. Adjusting this scale adjusts how faithful the generated output is to the prompt. It quantifies the rate of change of the variance of a diffusion process.
